why the name if it's written in erlang?
.......................................

I don't want to push efene as a forced dependency to everyone wanting to use fnt in languages like erlang, reia and LFE.

also because it will be in the efene standard library and I'm really bad at names ;)

that said efene is awesome so go and check it out!

license?
